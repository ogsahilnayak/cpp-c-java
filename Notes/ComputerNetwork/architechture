* java is a class based object oriented programming language.
* we can debug easily in java 
* it is developed by james gosling and later on it is acquire by oracle

features of java:

1. it is object oriented programming language
2. it is platform independent 
3. it is fairly simple and secure
4. java has a large standard library

Java Architecture:

source code ------> Compile(javac) ----->Bytecode(.class) ----> interpret-----> machine code (0/1)
Components:

JDK- java developement kid
JVM- java virtual machine 
JRE- java runtime environment


structure:

(a) JVM:
1. class loader
2. Memory area---> storage area(stack, leap etc)
3. execution engine---> interpreter + JIT compiler(Just in Time) + GC(garbage collector)

use of JIT compiler:

* it optimise the JVM performance
* repeated code 

use Garbage collector:

* unused memory ----> deallocate

(b) JRE:

* they need some runtime library

JRE = JVM + libraries

(c) JDK:

it include everything
